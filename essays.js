        content: "Time moves in circles, not lines. We return to the same moments, different people, carrying the weight of everything we've learned along the way.\n\nI found myself standing in the same coffee shop where I once waited for you, three years dissolved between that morning and this one.

Others have blossomed into interconnected webs of thought, linked to dozens of other pages."
